## Overview

The Job Profile Classification project is designed to classify job profiles based on various input features. This project leverages machine learning techniques to categorize job profiles into predefined classes, aiding in automating HR processes and enhancing job-matching algorithms.

## Technologies Used

Python

Jupyter Notebook

Scikit-learn

Pandas

NumPy

## Project Objectives

Automate job profile classification: Reduce manual effort in categorizing job profiles.

**Enhance accuracy:** Improve job-matching by accurately classifying profiles.

**Scalable solution:** Provide a scalable solution that can handle large datasets.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project consists of job profiles containing multiple features that describe the roles, responsibilities, and required skills. The features may include job titles, descriptions, required experience, and more.

## Dataset Overview

**Source:** https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yuvjeetarora/student-job-profile

**Features:**

Job Title: The title of the job.

Job Description: A detailed description of the job.

Required Skills: A list of skills required for the job.

Experience Level: The level of experience required (e.g., Junior, Mid-level, Senior).

Industry: The industry to which the job belongs.

## Features 

Data Preprocessing: Includes steps for cleaning, transforming, and preparing the data.

Model Training: Multiple machine learning models are trained and evaluated for performance.

Model Evaluation: Comparison of models based on accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Prediction: Functionality to predict the job profile class based on new input data.
## Installation

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

**Clone the repository:**

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Job_Profile_Classification.git

**Navigate to the project directory:**

cd Job_Profile_Classification

Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

Install the required packages:

pip install -r requirements.txt

## Usage

Open the Jupyter Notebook:

jupyter notebook Job_Profile_Classification.ipynb

**Run the cells sequentially:**
The notebook is designed to be executed in a step-by-step manner. Follow the instructions in each cell to preprocess data, train models, and evaluate results.

**Predict Job Profiles:**

After training the models, use the notebook to predict the classification of new job profiles.

## Configuration

No specific configurations are required to run this project. However, you may adjust hyperparameters within the notebook to explore different model performance.
